## Notes on Launching Positron from the WSL Command Line

It is sometimes convenient to launch Positron directly from a WSL directory using the command `positron .`.  To enable this feature, choose **Yes** when you see the following prompt:

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3b484f7-2eaa-464e-8eff-4969227c7a4d" alt="Positron WSL Prompt Image" width="400"/>

This sets the environment variable `POSITRON_WSL_EXTENSION_NAME` to `kv9898.open-remote-wsl`, which is read by the Positron launcher script when starting from WSL.

If you missed the prompt, you can manually enable this feature:

- Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS)
- Run the command:  
  **Register this WSL extension for launching Positron from WSL**

To disable this feature:

- Run the command:  
  **Unregister this WSL extension from Positron launcher**

Alternatively, you can manually remove the environment variable `POSITRON_WSL_EXTENSION_NAME` from your system settings.
